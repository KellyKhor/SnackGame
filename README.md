# Snake Game (Ruby)

A modern take on the classic Snake Game, built in Ruby with the Ruby2D library.
The snake grows longer as it eats food, the playerâ€™s score increases, and the game ends when the snake collides with itself.

## Features
- Classic snake mechanics (growth + collision detection).
- Customisable snake colours (choose from multiple options).
- Snake changes colour dynamically on collisions.
- Random ball generation.
- Score and high score tracking.
- Smooth keyboard controls (arrow keys).

## Tech Stack
- Language: Ruby
- Graphics/Input Library: Ruby2D

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Install [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/)  
- Install Ruby2D:
  ```bash
  gem install ruby2d
  ```

### Running the Game
```bash
# Navigate to project folder
cd "path/to/project"

# Run the game
ruby snake_game.rb
```

## What I Learned
- Building interactive 2D games with Ruby.
- Managing arrays for snake position and growth logic.
- Real-time keyboard input handling.
- Collision detection and state-based game logic.
- Enhancing user experience with customisation and visual feedback.
